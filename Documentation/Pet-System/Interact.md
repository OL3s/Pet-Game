# Interact

## Overview
The Interact system lets players engage with their pets through a variety of actions. Interactions are grouped into three main types: **Room Interactions**, **Close-Up Interactions**, and **Bath Interactions**. Each group offers different ways to care for and bond with your pets.

## Interaction Types

There are three main types of interactions:

- **Room Interactions:** Actions you can perform in the main room with all your pets present.
- **Close-Up Interactions:** Actions that take place in a close-up view focused on a single pet.
- **Bath Interactions:** Actions performed in a dedicated bathing scene for cleaning your pet.
