# Vet System

## Overview

The Vet system is used when your pet's health stat drops too low and the pet becomes sick. Visiting the vet is essential to restore your pet's health and prevent serious consequences.

## How It Works

- If your pet's health stat falls below a critical threshold, it will become sick and require a visit to the vet.
- At the vet, you can treat your pet and restore its health stat to a safe level.
- If you do not take your pet to the vet in time, the pet may eventually flee your home due to neglect.

## Purpose

The vet system encourages players to monitor their pet's health and respond quickly to illness, adding challenge and responsibility to pet care.
