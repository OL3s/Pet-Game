# Mood

## Overview
The Mood and Bonding System tracks your pet’s emotional state and the strength of its relationship with the player. These systems influence how your pet behaves, responds to interactions, and develops over time.

## Mood

The pet’s mood is affected by its needs (such as hunger, cleanliness, and social interaction) and by player actions. A happy pet will be more playful and responsive, while an unhappy pet may ignore the player or act out.

| Mood State   | Description                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Happy        | Pet is content and playful                  |
| Neutral      | Pet is calm but not particularly excited    |
| Sad          | Pet is unhappy, may ignore interactions     |
| Angry        | Pet is upset, may refuse to cooperate       |
| Excited      | Pet is energetic and eager to interact      |
