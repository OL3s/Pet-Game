# Hotel System

## Overview

The Hotel system allows players to place their pet in a hotel when they need to take a longer break from the game.

## Stat Behavior in Hotel

- While in the hotel, the pet’s main stats (such as hunger, happiness, and cleanliness) are slowly set towards their default values over time.
- The bonding stat, however, will slowly decrease while the pet is in the hotel.

## Purpose

This system helps players avoid negative consequences for their pet’s well-being during long absences, but encourages regular interaction to maintain a strong bond.
